# Fragment Shaders

  A few of my own shaders but mostly ripped off from [Patricio Gonzalez Vivo](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo)

## Running the dev server:

* Run `npm start` from the  terminal

## Running the production build:

* Run `npm run build` from the terminal. Built assets will appear in the dist folder.
